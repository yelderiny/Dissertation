The entry point for running the code is in the jupyter notebooks in each Approach.

Do not run the data extraction code in the notebooks, as the data is already extracted and saved in the data folder.

To plot the data, use the plot-data.ipynb in each Approach.
To preprocess the data, use the preprocess-data.ipynb in each Approach.
To run the models, use the models.ipynb in each Approach.
To run the neural network, use the keras.ipynb in each Approach.

Any variation of those files will do the same thing relative to the Approach they are in.
